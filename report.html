                As part of my term I web development assignment, I created a website that serves as my personal portfolio. <br> <br>

                Firstly at the beginning of this module, I was totally unaware of this course. I had very little knowledge of web development
                and the languages used in this process. Being from a biology background, it was really hard to understand the module leader's
                explanations at the beginning. It takes time to settle down and become accustomed to computers and programming languages. It
                was very challenging for me to understand at the beginning of classes. I watched YouTube videos to learn HTML and CSS. It 
                took so much time to get an understanding of the basics of these languages. Coursera classes helped me improve my web development
                a lot from tutorial classes, and my teachers taught me a lot about this module. I implemented my lectures at home and got a much
                better result than the previous days and I felt that I'm getting better and still improving myself day after day. <br><br>

                By observing different templates online in image formats, I made wireframes, and then I started coding. It was quite challenging 
                at the beginning to do without any references. Then I watched YouTube, and W3 schools and took ideas from these sources and I 
                learned from the notes provided by my teacher. Then I sought help from my teacher with what I needed to improve. <br><br>

                Numerous problems occurred during the development of this website. Firstly, the nav bar was not functioning as I wanted it to, 
                so I removed the search button and it looked better than before. Following that, I choose three color combinations for my overall 
                website. Talking about fonts, I imported the Poppins 'sans-serif' font face from the Google font library. <br><br>
